# MarioPaint
A Console Version of Mario Paint, made in C#


### Installation
As of now (2017) There is no support for Macs or Linux, as there is only a .exe file (x86)

### Usage 
You can double-click the app to run it, and it will open a CMD.exe window with the UI loaded up

### Options
Under the "debug" folder you can run a debugger mode of the application

Under the mpaint/obj/x86/Debug folder there is the .exe file (the "Debug" folder name was automatic...)

### Bugs 
If you try to run this .exe on Mac or Linux with Wine (Wine CLI too), it will produce some wonky errors

## Other Sections
Ignore the .DS_Store file, I'm working on a Mac  : )
